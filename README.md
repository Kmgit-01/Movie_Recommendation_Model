🎬 Movie Recommendation System (Content-Based Filtering)
📌 Overview

This project implements a content-based movie recommendation system using cosine similarity.
The system recommends movies based on similarity between movie titles using text vectorization techniques.

The dataset is derived from the TMDB 5000 Movies & Credits dataset, and the model is built using Python and Scikit-learn.

🚀 Features

Recommends top 5 similar movies for a given movie

Uses Count Vectorizer for text representation

Computes similarity using Cosine Similarity

Efficient and lightweight (no deep learning required)

Model artifacts saved using Pickle

🧠 Approach Used

Content-Based Filtering

The recommendation is generated by:

Converting movie titles into vectors

Measuring similarity between vectors

Recommending movies with highest similarity scores

🗂️ Dataset Information
📁 Datasets Used

movies.csv

tmdb_5000_credits.csv

🔑 Important Columns

movie_id

title

original_language

cast

crew

🛠️ Data Preprocessing Steps

Merged movies and credits datasets on title

Selected required columns only

Handled missing values

Removed duplicate records

📐 Model Architecture
🔹 Text Vectorization

Algorithm: CountVectorizer

Max Features: 5000

Stop Words: English

🔹 Similarity Measure

Metric: Cosine Similarity

⚙️ Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Pickle

💾 Model Persistence

movie_list.pkl → Stores movie titles and IDs

similarity.pkl → Stores cosine similarity matrix

These files can be reused in a web app (Flask / Streamlit) without retraining the model.

📈 Future Enhancements

Use overview, genres, keywords instead of only titles

Add TF-IDF Vectorizer

Build a Streamlit / Flask Web App

Include poster and rating-based recommendations

Improve accuracy using hybrid filtering
